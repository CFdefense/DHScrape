   Python web scrapper to scrape data about the current day's meals from <a href =https://dineoncampus.com/marist>Marist Dining Hall</a> and send the data to subscribers' phones daily. 
   <br />
   <br />
   I am building this because I want to be conscious of what's being served so that I can strategize my daily meals in accordance.
   <br />
   <br />
   Plus I am too lazy to check the website myself
