 <h4 align="center">Project Information</h4>
 <p align="center">
   Python web scrapper to scrape data about the current day's meals from <a href =https://dineoncampus.com/marist>Marist Dining Hall</a> and send the data to subscribers' phones daily. 
   <br />
   <br />
   I am building this because I live far from the dining hall and I want to know at all times if there's anything good to eat.
   <br />
   <br />
   Plus I am too lazy to check the website myself
