NOTIFCATION SENDING ** COMPLETE **

SMTP -> Format users numbers and carriers and send messages through SMTP server

DATA FORMATTING

Pandas/Image -> Format menu and AI recommendation in SMTP supported format for easy read by users

TIME CHECKS and AUTO START

OS Time Checks -> Ensure enough time has passed where a new menu is available either through OS calls to time or by comparing API call results

DATA COLLECTION

    IMAP -> Allows for reading of Emails Which is where our users responses will go
            -> Read Responses and associated Address and make that response to the address in our database

    DATABASE -> Store users and their responses
                -> Can use Json for now as usercount is low but migrating to a more advanced database will be need in future

AI PREDICTION

    -> We will use Regression/Random Forest/Forest to understand and predict user menu enjoyment

    REGRESSION AND RANDOM FOREST
    -> Break this down into user -> time of visit -> food ate -> reason
        -> Categorize foods and log prequency of attendance for that item along with the reason for going
            -> Predict based on factors such as previous attendance #s for foods
    FOREST
    -> Use forest on data set to recommend unique foods which are not normally offered by the dining hall
